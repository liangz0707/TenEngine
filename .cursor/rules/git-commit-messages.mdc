# Git Commit Messages

**All git commit messages must be written in English.**

This avoids garbled characters (mojibake) when viewing `git log` on GitHub, in terminals with different encodings, or in CI/CD tools.

## Rules

- Use **English only** for commit subject and body.
- Prefer clear, imperative style (e.g. "Add X", "Fix Y", "Update Z").
- Optionally follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).

## Examples

- ✅ `Add T0 contract for 001-core public API`
- ✅ `Fix merge conflict in specs/_contracts/README.md`
- ✅ `docs: sync interface-sync rule with T0-contracts`
- ❌ `添加核心模块契约` (use English instead)
- ❌ `修复合并冲突` (use English instead)

When suggesting or writing commit messages (e.g. in agent workflows, PRs, or local commits), always use English.
